# R development task view




The goal of this page is to list packages that are helpful for R development, excluding statistical subjects, which are covered elsewhere, and focusing on software engineering subjects. The packages are grouped by related activity. The tables are by no means exhaustive, first because this is work in progress, second because the goal is to list only *high quality packages*, where we'll try to better define *high quality* over time.  The page is partly generated by R code and uses information from the `DESCRIPTION` file in each package. This is to avoid duplicated, stale information and to give voice to the developers themselves.




## Testing
<!-- html table generated in R 3.1.2 by xtable 1.7-4 package -->
<!-- Sat Jan 24 22:02:32 2015 -->
<table border=1>
<tr> <th>  </th> <th> Title </th> <th> Description </th>  </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> assertthat </td> <td> Easy pre and post assertions. </td> <td> assertthat is an extension to stopifnot() that makes it
    easy to declare the pre and post conditions that you code should
    satisfy, while also producing friendly error messages so that your
    users know what they've done wrong. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> covr </td> <td> Test Coverage for R packages. </td> <td> Compute test coverage statistics for your package and (optionally)
    upload the results to coveralls. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> <a href="https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/quickcheck">quickcheck</a> </td> <td> Support for randomized software testing </td> <td> Provides functions to test and reproduce failures of assertions on random data. Also provides a variety of random data generators.  </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> <a href="https://github.com/hadley/testthat">testthat</a> </td> <td> Testthat code. Tools to make testing fun :) </td> <td> A testing package specifically tailored for R
    that's fun, flexible and easy to set up. </td> </tr>

## Profiling

<tr> <th>  </th> <th> Title </th> <th> Description </th>  </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> microbenchmark </td> <td> Accurate Timing Functions </td> <td> Provides infrastructure to accurately measure and compare
        the execution time of R expressions. </td> </tr>

## Data structures
<!-- html table generated in R 3.1.2 by xtable 1.7-4 package -->
<!-- Sat Jan 24 22:03:27 2015 -->
<table border=1>
<tr> <th>  </th> <th> Title </th> <th> Description </th>  </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> bitops </td> <td> Bitwise Operations </td> <td> Functions for bitwise operations on integer vectors. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> <a href="http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/,
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data.table">data.table</a> </td> <td> Extension of data.frame </td> <td> Fast aggregation of large data (e.g. 100GB in RAM), fast ordered joins, fast add/modify/delete of columns by group using no copies at all, list columns and a fast file reader (fread). Offers a natural and flexible syntax, for faster development. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a> </td> <td> A Grammar of Data Manipulation </td> <td> A fast, consistent tool for working with data frame like objects,
    both in memory and out of memory. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> <a href="http://had.co.nz/plyr">plyr</a> </td> <td> Tools for splitting, applying and combining data </td> <td> plyr is a set of tools that solves a common
    set of problems: you need to break a big problem down
    into manageable pieces, operate on each pieces and then
    put all the pieces back together.  For example, you
    might want to fit a model to each spatial location or
    time point in your study, summarise data by panels or
    collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary
    statistics. The development of plyr has been generously
    supported by BD (Becton Dickinson). </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td align="right"> magrittr </td> <td> A Forward-Pipe Operator for R </td> <td> Provides a mechanism for chaining commands with a
    new forward-pipe operator, %>%. This operator will forward a
    value, or the result of an expression, into the next function
    call/expression. There is flexible support for the type
    of right-hand side expressions. For more information, see
    package vignette.
