# R development task view




The goal of this page is to list packages that are helpful for R development, excluding statistical subjects, which are covered elsewhere, and focusing on software engineering subjects. The packages are grouped by related activity. The tables are by no means exhaustive, first because this is work in progress, second because the goal is to list only *high quality packages*, where we'll try to better define *high quality* over time.  The page is partly generated by R code and uses information from the `DESCRIPTION` file in each package. This is to avoid duplicated, stale information and to give voice to the developers themselves. It has been brought to my attention by @hadley that a discussion is under way to create a task view on the same theme on CRAN. I think this page still make sense because of its different format and emphasis and because it exists right now, bypassing byzantine discussions over the perfect number of views for a subject that now has zero, but it's not intended to compete with that effort. Also see a [prototype](https://github.com/lbraglia/PackageDevelopmentTaskView) of that by @lbraglia.

  This allows R objects to be inserted into Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript code
  and allows R programmers to read and convert JSON content to R objects.
  This is an alternative to rjson package. Originally, that was too slow for converting large R objects to JSON
  and was not extensible.  rjson's performance is now similar to this package, and perhaps slightly faster in some cases.
  This package uses methods and is readily extensible by defining methods for different classes, 
  vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions for deserializing JSON objects to R. 
  The two packages intentionally share the same basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many additional
  options to allow customizing the generation and processing of JSON content.
  This package uses libjson rather than implementing yet another JSON parser. The aim is to support
  other general projects by building on their work, providing feedback and benefit from their ongoing development. </td> </tr>

<tr> <th>  </th> <th> Title </th> <th> Description </th>  </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> </td> <td> A general-purpose package for dynamic report generation in R </td> <td> This package provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report
    generation in R, which can be used to deal with any type of (plain text)
    files, including Sweave, HTML, Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, and
    Textile. R code is evaluated as if it were copied and pasted in an R
    terminal thanks to the evaluate package (e.g., we do not need to explicitly
    print() plots from ggplot2 or lattice). R code can be reformatted by the
    formatR package so that long lines are automatically wrapped, with indent
    and spaces added, and comments preserved. A simple caching mechanism is
    provided to cache results from computations for the first time and the
    computations will be skipped the next time. Almost all common graphics
    devices, including those in base R and add-on packages like Cairo,
    cairoDevice and tikzDevice, are built-in with this package and it is
    straightforward to switch between devices without writing any special
    functions. The width and height as well as alignment of plots in the output
    document can be specified in chunk options (the size of plots for graphics
    devices is also supported). Multiple plots can be recorded in a single code
    chunk, and it is also allowed to rearrange plots to the end of a chunk or
    just keep the last plot. Warnings, messages and errors are written in the
    output document by default (can be turned off). The large collection of
    hooks in this package makes it possible for the user to control almost
    everything in the R code input and output. Hooks can be used either to
    format the output or to run R code fragments before or after a code chunk.
    The language in code chunks is not restricted to R (there is simple support
    to Python and shell scripts, etc). Many features are borrowed from or
    inspired by Sweave, cacheSweave, pgfSweave, brew and decumar. </td> </tr>

One comment, I know that `knitr` is for much more than literate programming. But from a developer point of view, that's what it does and I think the reporting features (e.g. executing code and showing the output) are a boon for literate programming as well, that is when the goal is to explain a program.

    reproducibility in R. Specifically, checkpoint allows you to install
    packages as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had
    a CRAN time machine.  To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function
    installs the packages required or called by your project and scripts to a
    local library exactly as they existed at the specified point in time. Only
    those packages are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package
    updates that came later and may have altered your results. In this way,
    anyone using checkpoint's checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of
    your scripts or projects at any time. To create the snapshot archives, once
    a day (at midnight UTC) we refresh the Austria CRAN mirror, on the "Managed
    R Archived Network" server (http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/).
    Immediately after completion of the rsync mirror process, we take a

 objects, as well as a function 'hmac()' to create hash-based message
 authentication code.

   The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1 
 and sha-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, 
 and the crc32 algorithm is described in 
 ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt.

   For md5, sha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses a small standalone
 implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code
 from the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron
 D. Gifford is used.

   Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for 
 cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely 
 tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used. </td> </tr>
