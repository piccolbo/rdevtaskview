# rdevtaskview
Annotated collection of packages that support programming in R. Not a specific statistical task, but programming in general. CS type-stuff. Table will be eventually split into multiple docs, for different programming tasks such as: data strutctures, data bases, big data, foreign language extensions etc.

See [view.md](https://github.com/piccolbo/rdevtaskview/blob/master/view.md).
Edits only to [view.Rmd](https://github.com/piccolbo/rdevtaskview/blob/master/view.Rmd). The final document is generated from there.
