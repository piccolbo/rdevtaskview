The goal of this page is to list packages that are helpful for R development, excluding statistical subjects, which are covered elsewhere, and focusing on software engineering subjects. The packages are grouped by related activity. The tables are by no means exhaustive, first because this is work in progress, second because the goal is to list only *high quality packages*, where we'll try to better define *high quality* over time.  The page is partly generated by R code and uses information from the `DESCRIPTION` file in each package. This is to avoid duplicated, stale information and to give voice to the developers themselves. It has been brought to my attention by @hadley that a discussion is under way to create a task view on the same theme on CRAN. I think this page still make sense because of its different format and emphasis and because it exists right now, bypassing byzantine discussions over the perfect number of views for a subject that now has zero, but it's not intended to compete with that effort. Also see a [prototype](https://github.com/lbraglia/PackageDevelopmentTaskView) of that by @lbraglia. 


```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(devtools)

ip = 
  function(x, from = c("cran", "github"), ...)
    if(!require(x, character.only = TRUE)) {
      from = match.arg(from)
      if(from == "cran")
        install.packages(x, ...)
      else 
        install_github(x, ...)}

library(xtable)

make.table = 
  function(packages) {
    viewname = as.character(substitute(packages))
    packages = sort(names(packages))
    table = 
      cbind(
        Title  = sapply(packages, function(x) packageDescription(x)$Title),
        Description = sapply(packages, function(x) packageDescription(x)$Description))
    row.names(table) = 
      sapply(
        packages, 
        function(x) {
          url = packageDescription(x)$URL
          if(is.null(url)) x
          else paste0("<a href=\"", url, "\">", x, "</a>")})
    print(
      xtable(
        label = "viewname",
        table),
      type = "html",
      sanitize.text.function = force)}
```

## Testing
```{r}
testing = 
  list(
    testthat = ip("testthat"),
    quickcheck = ip(from = "github","RevolutionAnalytics/quickcheck/pkg"), 
    assertthat = ip("assertthat", type = "source"),
    RUnit = ip("RUnit"),
    covr = ip("covr"))
make.table(testing)
```

## Profiling
```{r}
profiling = 
  list(
    microbenchmark = ip("microbenchmark"))
make.table(profiling)
```


## Data structures
```{r}
data.structures = 
  list(
    plyr = ip("plyr"),
    dplyr = ip("dplyr"), 
    data.table = ip("data.table"),
    bitops = ip("bitops"))
make.table(data.structures)
```

## Language processing or extension

```{r}
language =
  list(
    compiler = ip("compiler"),
    pryr = ip("pryr"),
    lazyeval = ip("lazyeval"),
    magrittr = ip("magrittr"),
    Formula = ip("Formula"))
make.table(language)
```

## Distributed programming

```{r}
distributed =
  list(
    rmr2 = ip(from = "github","RevolutionAnalytics/rmr2/pkg"), 
    plyrmr = ip(from = "github","RevolutionAnalytics/plyrmr/pkg"), 
    SparkR = ip(from = "github","amplab-extras/SparkR-pkg", subdir="pkg"))
make.table(distributed)
```

## Parallel programming

For this also see the HPC task view on CRAN, which includes lots of other things that have nothing to deal with parallel or HPC.
```{r}
parallel = 
  list(
    snow = ip("snow"), 
    ROpenCL = ip("ROpenCL"))
make.table(parallel)
```

## Interfaces to other languages

```{r}
foreign = 
  list(
    Rcpp = ip("Rcpp"), 
    rJava = ip("rJava"), 
    V8 = ip("V8"))
make.table(foreign)
```
## Formats

```{r}
format = 
  list(
    RJSONIO = ip("RJSONIO"),
    rjson = ip("rjson"),
    ravro = ip(from = "github","RevolutionAnalytics/ravro", subdir = "pkg/ravro"))
make.table(format)
```

## Documentation

```{r}
documentation = 
  list(
    roxygen2 = ip("roxygen2"))
make.table(documentation)
```
## Literate programming

```{r}
literate =
  list(
    knitr = ip("knitr"))
make.table(literate)
```

One comment, I know that `knitr` is for much more than literate programming. But from a developer point of view, that's what it does and I think the reporting features (e.g. executing code and showing the output) are a boon for literate programming as well, that is when the goal is to explain a program. 

## Database

```{r}
database = 
  list(
    RSQLite = ip("RSQLite"))
make.table(database)
```

## UI

```{r}
UI = 
  list(
    shiny = ip("shiny"))
make.table(UI)
```

## Dependency management

```{r}
deployment = 
  list(
    packrat = ip("packrat"), 
    checkpoint = ip("checkpoint"))
make.table(deployment)
```

## Miscellaneous

```{r}
miscellaneous = 
  list(
    digest = ip("digest"), 
    devtools = ip("devtools"))
make.table(miscellaneous)
```
